# hipstermaker

This project was created for Unit 1 - Project 1 of GA's Software Engineering Immersive course.

As mentioned in the "About" section, there's no real objective or useful purpose for this webapp other than good ol' fashioned humor and a bit of healthy self-introspection, as I too can be a bit of an awful elitist millennial with "elevated" music tastes. Years of collecting vinyl records and reveling in the obscure has ruined me, so why not code something that directly makes fun of this very fact?

Three APIs are used by the Hipster Make to generate new profiles of 20-30somethings as well as random music genres which mostly don't exist:

I. UINames Random Person Generator
II. Binary Jazz Story "Genre"nator
III. Binary Jazz Music "Genre"nator

(See how I used Roman numerals instead of of numbers? Gosh I'm such a hipster.)

Post-MVP goals:

Mobile version admittedly needs a lot of work, and I'd really like to get the hamburger menu functional. But honestly, if you're viewing the Hipster Maker on a phone and not a vintage tube monitor computer, are you really even a hipster at all?
