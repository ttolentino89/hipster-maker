This project was created for Unit 1 - Project 1 of GA's Software Engineering Immersive course.

As mentioned in the "About" section, there's no real objective or useful purpose for this webapp other than good ol' fashioned fun and a bit of healthy self-introspection, as I too can be a bit of an awful elitist millennial with "elevated" music tastes. Years of collecting vinyl records and reveling in the obscure has ruined me, so why not code something that directly makes fun of this very fact?
